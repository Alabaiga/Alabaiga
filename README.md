- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Alabaiga! 
- I'm interested in connecting with like minded people and breaking into the field of full stacks development.
- Currently, I'm learning JavaScript and not so far in the distant future Node.js. I've dabbled in python and C# before but only briefly.
- I'm not actively looking to collaborate currently, as I feel I'm still too new to provide much but I am looking to connect with people in the field.
- I can be reached at cgonz1093@gmail.com for any inquiries.
- Thanks!
